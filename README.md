Hei! This is a Palworld breeding calculator built with Typescript, styled-components, and React, with a simple MongoDB + Express.js backend.

This project is still under development and a lot of refactoring needs to be done.

However, the project does have a live site (for fun) that gets updated periodically whenever there is a major update. [palw.fly.dev](https://palw.fly.dev)

Breeding data is obtained from [this thread.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palworld/comments/19d98ws/spreadsheet_all_breeding_combinations_datamined/)
